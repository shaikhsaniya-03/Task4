# Task4 : Aggregate Functions and Grouping

__1. Apply aggregate functions on numeric columns:__
Aggregate functions (like SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), MAX(), MIN()) are used to perform calculations on a set of rows and return a single summary value. These are typically applied to numeric columns.

__2. Use GROUP BY to categorize:__
The GROUP BY clause is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows. This allows aggregate functions to be applied to each group independently.

__3. Filter groups using HAVING:__
The HAVING clause is used to filter the results of a GROUP BY clause. Unlike WHERE, which filters individual rows before grouping, HAVING filters groups based on conditions applied to aggregate functions.
